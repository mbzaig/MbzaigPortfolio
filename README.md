## Features

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-100%25-Green)
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-100%25-Green)
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-100%25-Green)
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-100%25-Green)
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-100%25-Green)
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-100%25-Green)


## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
